Q1: What is the difference between Java & JavaScript?

-Java is a Compiled language, which means code is  converted into machine-readable format before running. Javascript is an Interpreted language, which mean code runs directly without compilation.

-Java is used for creating Android apps, enterprise software, big data applications. Javascript is used for creating front-end and back-end of web development, game development.

-Java is statically typed means data type is defined before running the code. JavaScript is dynamically typed, in this data type is defined while running.

-Java supports multithreading which allows multiple small programs to run concurrently inside a process. Javascript is Single-threaded means it runs one piece of code at a time but it uses asynchronous programming to handle multiple requests.

Q2. What is JavaScript?

-JavaScript is a programming language used in web development and it was created by Brendan Eich in 1995.
-It runs in web browsers and is used to create interactive and dynamic web pages.
-JavaScript is interpreted language, which mean code runs directly without compilation.
- JavaScript is dynamically typed, in this data type is defined while running.
- It is a cross-platform language so that it runs consistently across different devices and operating systems.
- t has various libraries and frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js for front-end development, and Express.js for back-end development.

Q3. What are the data types supported by JavaScript?

-It supports several data types which are Number, String, Boolean , undefined, null, object, BigInt

1 - Number
Represents integer and floating-point numbers.
Example let age = 25;

2- String

Represents sequences of characters. 
Example let name = "John Doe";
 
3 - Boolean

Represents logical values: true or false. 
Example let isActive = true;
 
4 - undefined

A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

5 - Null

Represents empty value . 
Example let y = null;

6 – Object

A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (or Symbols) and values can be any type.
Example

let person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    isMember: true
};

7 – BigInt

Represents very large whole numbers. 
Example: let bigIntValue = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

Q4. What are the scopes of a variable in JavaScript?

- Global Scope means variables declared outside of any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from anywhere in the code.

-Function Scope means variables declared within a function cannot be accessed outside of it. 

- Block Scope means variables declared with let or const within a block are in block scope. This includes blocks defined by loops, conditionals ,etc.

Q5. What is Callback?
- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of action .

function fetchData(callback) { 
    setTimeout(() => {
        let data = "Data retrieved from server";
        callback(data); 
    }, 2000);
}
function processData(data) {
    console.log("Processing data: " + data);
}
fetchData(processData);

Q6. What is Closure? Give an example.
A closure is a concept in JavaScript where an inner function has access to the variables of an outer function, even after the outer function has finished running.

Example
function outerFunction() {
    let outerVariable = "Hello, I'm an outer variable";
    function innerFunction() {
        console.log(outerVariable); // Inner function can access outerVariable
    }
    return innerFunction; // Return the inner function
}
const closureFunction = outerFunction(); 
closureFunction(); 

Q7. What is the difference between the operators ‘==‘ & ‘===‘?

== (Equality Operator) – This operator compares two values for equality after converting them to a common type. This is known as type coercion. 

=== (Strict Equality Operator) - This operator compares two values for equality without performing type coercion. 

Example
console.log(5 === '5'); // false, because 5 is a number and '5' is a string

Q8. What is the difference between null & undefined?

- undefined - When a variable is declared but not assigned a value, its default value is undefined.
- null - It is an explicit value that represents empty value which is assigned by the programmer.
 
Q9. What would be the result of 2+5+”3″?

-JavaScript performs the addition operation from left to right so 2+5 will be 7 and then javascript converts 7 to string and combination of 7 and 3 is 73.

Q10. What is the difference between Call & Apply?

- call method calls function with a given this value (an object) and arguments provided individually. Syntax : func.call(thisArg, arg1, arg2,..)

- apply method calls a function with a given this value, and arguments provided as an array. Syntax : func.apply(thisArg, [argsArray])
